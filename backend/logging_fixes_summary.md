# Logging Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Rich Library Recursion Error
- **Problem**: Rich library's ConsoleRenderer was causing recursion errors with pretty printing
- **Solution**: 
  - Disabled colors in development: `ConsoleRenderer(colors=False)`
  - Used plain traceback formatter: `exception_formatter=structlog.dev.plain_traceback`
  - Simplified processor chain to avoid recursion

### 2. Excessive Request Logging
- **Problem**: Every HTTP request was being logged with verbose details
- **Solution**:
  - Changed default LOG_LEVEL from "INFO" to "WARNING"
  - Set uvicorn.access log level to "ERROR" (disables access logs)
  - Set uvicorn log level to "WARNING"
  - Reduced auth middleware logging to only log for sensitive endpoints

### 3. Database and External Library Verbosity
- **Problem**: SQLAlchemy, httpx, and other libraries were logging too much
- **Solution**:
  - Set sqlalchemy.engine to "ERROR" level (only SQL errors)
  - Set sqlalchemy.pool to "ERROR" level
  - Set httpx to "ERROR" level
  - Added specific "app" logger with WARNING level for development

### 4. Middleware Logging Reduction
- **Problem**: Auth and rate limit middleware were logging every operation
- **Solution**:
  - Reduced Redis connection logs to DEBUG level
  - Changed rate limit errors to DEBUG level
  - Only log authentication for sensitive endpoints (/api/v1/auth/, /api/v1/sync/)
  - Reduced startup/shutdown logs to WARNING level

### 5. Environment Configuration
- **Problem**: No .env file meant using default verbose settings
- **Solution**:
  - Created backend/.env with LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
  - Set appropriate development defaults

## Files Modified:

1. **backend/app/core/logging.py**
   - Simplified structlog processors for development
   - Disabled colors and reduced Rich library usage
   - Set appropriate log levels for all loggers

2. **backend/app/core/config.py**
   - Changed default LOG_LEVEL from "INFO" to "WARNING"

3. **backend/app/api/middleware/auth.py**
   - Reduced authentication logging to only sensitive endpoints
   - Changed debug logs to info level

4. **backend/app/api/middleware/rate_limit.py**
   - Reduced Redis connection and error logs to DEBUG level
   - Made rate limiting less verbose

5. **backend/main.py**
   - Changed startup/shutdown logs to WARNING level

6. **backend/.env** (new file)
   - Set LOG_LEVEL=WARNING for development
   - Added necessary environment variables

## Expected Results:

After restarting the backend server, you should see:
- ✅ No more Rich library recursion errors
- ✅ No HTTP access logs flooding the terminal
- ✅ Only warnings and errors are displayed
- ✅ Clean, readable terminal output
- ✅ Essential error messages still visible
- ✅ Improved terminal performance

## To Apply Changes:

The server needs to be restarted to pick up the new configuration:
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart with:
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The new logging configuration will automatically use WARNING level and suppress verbose output.
