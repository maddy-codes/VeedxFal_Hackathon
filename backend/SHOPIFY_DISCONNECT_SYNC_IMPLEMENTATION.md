# Shopify Disconnect and Sync Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive implementation of Shopify store disconnect and product sync functionality with enhanced logging capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Store Disconnect Functionality

**Location**: [`backend/app/services/shopify_service.py`](backend/app/services/shopify_service.py) - `disconnect_store()` method

**Features**:
- ✅ Comprehensive store cleanup and deactivation
- ✅ Access token clearing for security
- ✅ Related data cleanup (products, sync jobs, webhook events)
- ✅ Detailed logging throughout the process
- ✅ Error handling and rollback capabilities
- ✅ Performance metrics and duration tracking

**Cleanup Operations**:
1. **Sync Jobs**: Cancel all pending/running sync jobs
2. **Products**: Mark all products as inactive (preserves data)
3. **Webhook Events**: Mark unprocessed events as processed
4. **Store**: Clear access token and deactivate store
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive business event logging

**API Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/v1/shopify/stores/{shop_id}`

### 2. Complete Product Sync Implementation

**Location**: [`backend/app/services/shopify_service.py`](backend/app/services/shopify_service.py) - `_run_product_sync()` method

**Features**:
- ✅ Full product catalog synchronization from Shopify
- ✅ Pagination handling for large product catalogs
- ✅ Rate limiting and API call optimization
- ✅ Individual variant processing (each variant = separate product)
- ✅ Progress tracking and real-time updates
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Database transaction safety

**Sync Process**:
1. **Initialization**: Create sync job and validate store
2. **Fetching**: Paginated retrieval of all products from Shopify
3. **Processing**: Process each product variant individually
4. **Database Operations**: Upsert products using correct schema (`sku_id`)
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates every 10 products
6. **Completion**: Final statistics and cleanup

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/shopify/stores/{shop_id}/sync/products`

### 3. Enhanced Logging System

**Location**: [`backend/app/core/logging.py`](backend/app/core/logging.py)

**New Logging Functions**:

#### `log_sync_operation()`
- Tracks sync operations with detailed metrics
- Includes progress percentages and performance data
- Safe parameter handling to prevent logging errors

#### `log_shopify_api_call()`
- Logs all Shopify API calls with rate limiting info
- Tracks response times and status codes
- Monitors API usage patterns

#### `log_product_sync_progress()`
- Detailed product sync progress tracking
- Variant-level statistics (created, updated, failed)
- Success rate calculations

#### `log_store_operation()`
- Store-level operations (connect, disconnect, etc.)
- Duration tracking and status monitoring
- User and shop identification

#### `log_webhook_processing()`
- Webhook event processing logs
- Processing status and duration tracking
- Error handling and retry information

### 4. Enhanced API Client with Logging

**Location**: [`backend/app/services/shopify_service.py`](backend/app/services/shopify_service.py) - `ShopifyApiClient._make_request()`

**Features**:
- ✅ Comprehensive API call logging
- ✅ Rate limit monitoring and logging
- ✅ Request/response timing
- ✅ Error categorization and logging
- ✅ Retry attempt tracking

### 5. Database Schema Compliance

**Features**:
- ✅ Correct use of `sku_id` primary key in products table
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships
- ✅ Transaction safety for data consistency
- ✅ Upsert operations for product updates

## Testing

### Test Script
**Location**: [`backend/test_disconnect_and_sync.py`](backend/test_disconnect_and_sync.py)

**Test Coverage**:

```

### Manual Testing with Connected Store

1. **Verify Store Connection**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/shopify/stores" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
   ```

2. **Start Product Sync**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/shopify/stores/{shop_id}/sync/products" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
        -d '{"shop_id": 123, "full_sync": true}'
   ```

3. **Monitor Sync Progress**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/shopify/stores/{shop_id}/sync/jobs" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
   ```

4. **Disconnect Store** (careful!):
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/shopify/stores/{shop_id}" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
   ```
