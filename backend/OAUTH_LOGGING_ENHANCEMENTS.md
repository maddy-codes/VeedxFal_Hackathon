# OAuth Token Exchange Logging Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive logging enhancements made to the Shopify OAuth callback and token exchange process to help diagnose exactly where the code-to-access-token exchange is failing.

## Enhanced Files

### 1. `/backend/app/services/shopify_service.py`

#### `exchange_oauth_code` Method Enhancements

The main token exchange method now includes detailed logging at every step:

**Input Validation Logging:**
- Validates and logs all input parameters (shop_domain, code, user_id)
- Logs OAuth code length and preview (first 10 characters)
- Validates OAuth credentials configuration
- Logs presence of SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID and SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET

**Request Preparation Logging:**
- Logs the complete token URL being called
- Logs request payload structure (without exposing sensitive data)
- Logs client ID preview and secret presence confirmation

**HTTP Request/Response Logging:**
- Logs HTTP method, URL, and headers being sent
- Logs response status code and headers received
- Logs response content length and structure
- For successful responses: logs JSON structure and access token presence
- For error responses: logs complete error body and details

**Token Extraction Logging:**
- Logs access token presence and length
- Logs scope information
- Validates token extraction success

**Shop Verification Logging:**
- Logs shop API client creation
- Logs shop information retrieval
- Logs shop details (name, ID, domain)
- Comprehensive error logging for shop access failures

**Database Operations Logging:**
- Logs store data creation process
- Logs database upsert operation details
- Logs database operation results
- Comprehensive error handling for database failures

**Final Steps Logging:**
- Logs business event creation
- Logs webhook setup (with non-critical error handling)
- Logs final store object creation

### 2. `/backend/app/api/v1/shopify.py`

#### `_process_oauth_callback` Method Enhancements

The OAuth callback processing now includes:

**Callback Reception Logging:**
- Logs request method and client IP
- Logs all callback parameters (code, state, HMAC, timestamp)
- Logs parameter presence and lengths

**Parameter Validation:**
- Validates required parameters with detailed error logging
- Logs validation success/failure

**State Processing:**
- Detailed logging of user ID extraction from state parameter
- IP verification logging with security event tracking
- Comprehensive error handling for state parsing

**Service Call Logging:**
- Logs the call to the token exchange service
- Logs all parameters being passed to the service
- Logs service call completion and results

## Logging Levels and Structure

### Log Levels Used:
- `logger.info()` - Normal process flow and successful operations
- `logger.warning()` - Non-critical issues (like IP mismatches)
- `logger.error()` - Errors and failures that need attention

### Log Structure:
- **Section Headers**: Clear section markers like `=== STARTING OAUTH TOKEN EXCHANGE ===`
- **Success Indicators**: ✓ symbols for successful operations
- **Error Indicators**: ❌ symbols for failures
- **Parameter Logging**: Detailed parameter values (with security considerations)
- **Error Context**: Full error types, messages, and tracebacks

## Security Considerations

The logging implementation includes several security measures:

1. **Sensitive Data Protection:**
   - OAuth codes are logged with length and preview only (first 10 characters)
   - Access tokens are logged with length and prefix only (first 8 characters)
   - Client secrets are never logged, only their presence is confirmed

2. **IP Verification:**
   - Logs IP mismatches as security events
   - Continues processing despite IP mismatches (for proxy compatibility)

3. **State Parameter Validation:**
   - Comprehensive validation and logging of state parameter format
   - Security event logging for invalid state formats

## Debugging Capabilities

With these enhancements, you can now diagnose:

1. **Input Parameter Issues:**
   - Missing or invalid shop domains, codes, or user IDs
   - OAuth credential configuration problems

2. **HTTP Request Issues:**
   - Exact URL being called
   - Request headers and payload structure
   - Network connectivity problems

3. **Shopify API Response Issues:**
   - HTTP status codes and error messages
   - Response structure and content
   - Missing or invalid access tokens

4. **Database Issues:**
   - Store creation and saving problems
   - Database connectivity issues
   - Data validation errors

5. **Shop Verification Issues:**
   - API client creation problems
   - Shop information retrieval failures
   - Access token validation issues

## Usage

To use these enhanced logs for debugging:

1. **Set appropriate log level** in your environment (INFO or DEBUG)
2. **Monitor the logs** during OAuth flow testing
3. **Look for section headers** to identify which step is failing
4. **Check for error indicators** (❌) and error messages
5. **Review parameter values** to ensure they're correct
6. **Examine HTTP request/response details** for API issues

## Example Log Flow

A successful OAuth exchange will show logs like:
```
=== STARTING OAUTH TOKEN EXCHANGE ===
✓ Input validation passed
=== PREPARING TOKEN EXCHANGE REQUEST ===
=== SENDING TOKEN EXCHANGE REQUEST ===
=== RECEIVED TOKEN EXCHANGE RESPONSE ===
✓ Access token received
=== EXTRACTING ACCESS TOKEN ===
✓ Access token extracted successfully
=== VERIFYING SHOP ACCESS ===
✓ Shop access verified successfully
=== CREATING STORE DATA ===
✓ Store data object created successfully
=== SAVING TO DATABASE ===
✓ Store saved to database successfully
=== OAUTH TOKEN EXCHANGE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ===
```

A failed exchange will show detailed error information at the point of failure, making it easy to identify the exact issue.
