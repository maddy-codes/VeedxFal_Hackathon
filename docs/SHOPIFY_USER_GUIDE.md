## Product Synchronization

### How Sync Works

The platform synchronizes your Shopify products in two ways:

- Happens automatically in the background
- No action required from you

#### 2. Manual Sync
- Triggered by you when needed
- Useful for initial setup or troubleshooting
- Two types available: Quick Sync and Full Sync

### Sync Types

#### Quick Sync (Incremental)
- **When to use**: Regular updates and maintenance
- **What it does**: Only syncs products modified since last sync
- **Duration**: Usually 1-5 minutes
- **Recommended**: For daily/weekly updates

#### Full Sync (Complete)

- **Recommended**: For troubleshooting or major catalog changes
